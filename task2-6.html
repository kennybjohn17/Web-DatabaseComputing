<h1>Check out my borders</h1>
<p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.<br>Other elements can have borders too, like <span id="red-border"> this span with the class red border</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color; <br>all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.<br><br>Alternately,  <span id="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red outline class).</span><br>This prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>

</div>
	<p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
	<div id="red-border"><p>This div has a red border</p></div><div id="blue-border"><p>This div has a blue border</p></div>
	<p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
	<div id="new-red-border"><p>This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners.</p></div>
	<div id="new-blue-border"><p>This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</p></div>
