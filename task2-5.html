<h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
<p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.<br><br>
Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span id="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span id="fancy"> and this span has a font family of cursive, </span> because they belongs to two classes called blue and fancy respectively.<br>On the other hand, <span id="fancy"><span id="blue">this text is both blue and fancy!</span></span></p>
</div>
<div><p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p></div>
